This is a strategic advanced level snake game coded in java including dodging obstacles and speed changes

Open this project in any java IDE neatbeans, eclipse and run the project, if you are experiancing any issues
then just create a new project on the IDE and name it game, this snake game project by default has the game package header and copy
all the files from the src folder into your game project.

# *Note to be able to use custom images follow the guide below

In your IDE (netbeans) go to your project name right click and choose properties and on sources category under source package
folders click add folder and select your current project on look in then create a reasouce folder name it any
folder in my case i named it resource and add any images you would like to use on this game, you copy and paste the images i provided on the resource folder

Once all steps above are done build and run the project.
